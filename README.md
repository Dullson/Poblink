# Poblink Userscript
This userscript adds pob protocol links next to pastebin / pobb.in / poe.ninja links on various websites. These links are like shortcuts to open PoB and load the build with one click!


# Installing
- First, you need a userscript manager extension like [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) to run the script.
- Then, you can install the userscript via clicking [this link](https://github.com/Dullson/Poblink/raw/master/Poblink.user.js) or using the `Poblink.user.js` file on the master branch.
- You also need to setup link protocol association using [Poblink Setup](https://github.com/Dullson/PoblinkSetup) or the generated links won't work.

Currently the script works on PoE forums, Youtube, Reddit, Twitch chat and many other sites (using a generic parser).

Direct import support for Poe.Ninja build page and Poe profile page is also planned but not ready on the PoB side yet.
